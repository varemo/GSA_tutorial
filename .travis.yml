# This should test:
# - that the docker image can be built from the Docker file
# - that the R-code in the Rmd file can be run in the docker image
# - that an html can be generated from the Rmd file in the docker image and passed to the travis file system
# - that a copy of the html, showing the answers, can be made
# - push the new html files to github pages
