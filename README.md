### GitHub    

GitHub push --> new Docker built automatically on Docker hub, available through docker pull
            |-> Travis CI testing and webpage deployment

Commits are tagged at each course for easy access of the state of the repo at a given course (see Releases).  
Travis status badge added to README.md from Travis.

### Dockerfile
* Built from rocker/tidyverse image that contains R and Rstudio. 
* Adds on: 
  - installation of required R packages
  - data/ directory from GitHub
In Docker Hub: Create Auto-build from GitHub was selected to get the automated build to work.
This means that the image can be pulled (without building locally) by `docker pull varemo/GSA_tutorial`.
At Docker hub one can set build settings. Here a build was set on relevant git tags (i.e. courses).
So one can e.g. run `docker pull varemo/GSA_tutorial:NGS_course_GU_2017` to get the Docker image in the state it was at that course.

### Travis CI
Connect to GitHub repo at travis-ci.org. This sets up automatic testing at push to GitHub.
A GitHub token is added as an Environmental variable under settings at travis-ci.org.
The token is created in GitHub under user settings - Developer settings - Personal access tokens.
The Travis CI testing includes:
  * test Docker build from Docker file
  * test run code in Rmd file
  * build html from Rmd file
  * make a copy of html file where answers are displayed
  * push back the 2 html files to gh-pages branch on GitHub
